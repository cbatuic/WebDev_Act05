A UX + UI activity for the design of a responsive website for a school alumni networking website.

A lot of schools have their own intranet for networking with alumni (former students who have already graduated). Create a wireframe that a student will be able to benefit from the alumni site by **asking and receiving career advice**, **listened to first-hand stories from different professionals**, and **schedule an online tutorial session**.

Using your [submitted wireframe](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VtSMg-OGauwCmtP4hwLthcWbpL3S058X?usp=sharing) last week, create a HTML5, CSS3, and a JS6 scripts based on your low fidelty wireframe.
